# Database Triggers

Database triggers are stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to certain database events, such as insertions, updates, or deletions on a table. Django does not provide direct support for defining triggers, but you can use raw SQL statements to create triggers in your database.

### Example
Suppose you have a table `Order` with a trigger that updates the `total_amount` column whenever an order item is inserted or updated. You can define the trigger using raw SQL statements:

```python
from django.db import connection

def create_order_trigger():
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("""
            CREATE TRIGGER update_total_amount
            AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON order_item
            FOR EACH ROW
            BEGIN
                UPDATE "order" SET total_amount = (
                    SELECT SUM(quantity * price)
                    FROM order_item
                    WHERE order_item.order_id = "order".id
                ) WHERE id = NEW.order_id;
            END;
        """)

create_order_trigger()
```

In the above example, the trigger named `update_total_amount` is created using raw SQL statements to update the `total_amount` column in the `Order` table based on the values in the `order_item` table.
